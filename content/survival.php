<h2>Surviving the Apocalypse</h2>
With the Apocalypse nearing, it is important to be well-prepared. To this end, we've
prepared a handy survival guide. Pin it to your fridge, keep it in your wallet. Take
several and give them to your friends.

Things to look out for:
<ol>
<li><b>False Prophets</b> -  There are a lot of musicals around, it's easy to get confused. Keep your wits about you so that you don't get tricked.</li>
<li><b>Plague of Sores</b> - One word: savlon.</li>
<li><b>Rain of hail, fire and blood</b> - Avoid buildings with thatched rooves. Purchase a suitable umbrella, preferably one that won't melt like a shell-suit at a firework display.</li>
<li><b>Plague of mutant locusts</b> - If you see locusts with stinging scorpion's tails and lions heads that JUST WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE, stay off the absinthe. Just stick it out, apparently they'll go away after five months (just in time for winter).</li>
<li><b>Eclipses</b> -  Buy a torch and eat lots of carrots. Remember, you should never look directly at the sun, even during an eclipse. Patrick Moore will be in Cornwall for a live televised broadcast of the clouds.</li>
<li><b>Meteorites</b> - NASA are already working on sending Bruce Willis into space with a dirty vest and a team of specialist oil-rig workers in order to nuke anything that comes too close. </li>
</ol>
