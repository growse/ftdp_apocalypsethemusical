<h2>Apocalypse: The Musical</h2>
<p><a href = "http://www.ftdp.co.uk">Feed The Ducks Productions</a> presents Newton & Merry's <i>Apocalypse: The Musical</i>, returning to the Edinburgh Fringe for summer 2008! Opening on July 30th, <i>Apocalypse</i> will play odd days through August with the final performance on the 25th.</p>
<p>Misguided but well-meaning nuns, cows, angels and grapes take their part on the cosmic stage in this classic tale of milkman-meets-whore, set against the backdrop of end of the world. <i>Apocalypse</i> romps through the surreal and the sublime as God and Satan prepare for the End with miracles, mayhem, misuse of an ironing-board and the best udder-choreography you may ever see. The only show ever to get a five-star-plus rating from Broadway Baby, <i>Apocalypse</i> is far too fun to miss.</p>
<p>"Go buy a ticket for <i>Apocalypse: The Musical</i> now. It's the funniest musical ever. Period... If you miss this, you'll be missing one of the Fringe's best shows in nearly a decade." *****+ (Broadway Baby)</P>
<p>"A delightful bit of late-night entertainment... the best musical laugh you'll get on the Fringe." ***** (British Theatre Guide)</p>
