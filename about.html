<h1>About the Show</h1>


<p>Misguided but well-meaning nuns, cows, angels and grapes take their part on the cosmic stage in this classic tale of milkman-meets-whore, set against the backdrop of end of the world. <span>Apocalypse</i> romps through the surreal and the sublime as God and Satan prepare for the End with miracles, mayhem, misuse of an ironing-board and the best udder-choreography you may ever see. The only show ever to get a five-star-plus rating from Broadway Baby, <span>Apocalypse</i> is far too fun to miss.</p>

<p>"It's the funniest musical ever. Period... If you miss this, you'll be missing one of the Fringe's best shows in nearly a decade" ***** (Broadway Baby)<br />"A delightful bit of late-night entertainment... the best musical laugh you'll get on the Fringe" ***** (British Theatre Guide)</p>
